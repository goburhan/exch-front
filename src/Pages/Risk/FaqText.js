    { title: "Regulatory Landscape", content: "Cryptocurrencies currently face an uncertain regulatory landscape in many jurisdictions. In addition, many cryptocurrency derivatives are regulated by the provisions of national and supra-national (i.e. EU) securities legislation; moreover, some state securities regulators have cautioned that many initial coin offerings are likely to fall within the definition of a security and subject to their respective securities laws. One or more jurisdictions may, in the future, adopt laws, regulations or directives that affect cryptocurrency networks and their users. Such laws, regulations or directives may impact the price of cryptocurrencies and their acceptance by users, merchants and service providers.Legislative and regulatory changes or actions at the state, federal, or international level may adversely affect the use, transfer, exchange, and value of cryptocurrency.Purchasing cryptocurrencies comes with a number of risks, including volatile market price swings or flash crashes, market manipulation, and cybersecurity risks.In addition, cryptocurrency markets and exchanges are not regulated with the same controls or customer protections available in equity, option, futures, or foreign exchange investing.There is no assurance that a person who accepts a cryptocurrency as payment today will continue to do so in the future.Investors should conduct extensive research into the legitimacy of each individual cryptocurrency, including its platform, before investing.The features, functions, characteristics, operation, use and other properties of the specific cryptocurrency may be complex, technical, or difficult to understand or evaluate.The cryptocurrency may be vulnerable to attacks on the security, integrity or operation, including attacks using computing power sufficient to overwhelm the normal operation of the cryptocurrency’s blockchain or other underlying technology.Some cryptocurrency transactions will be deemed to be made when recorded on a public ledger, which is not necessarily the date or time that a transaction may have been initiated.Cryptocurrency trading requires knowledge of cryptocurrency markets.In attempting to profit through cryptocurrency trading you must compete with traders worldwide.You should have appropriate knowledge and experience before engaging in substantial cryptocurrency trading.Any individual cryptocurrency may change or otherwise cease to operate as expected due to changes made to its underlying technology, changes made using its underlying technology, or changes resulting from an attack.These changes may include, without limitation, a 'fork,''a 'rollback,' an 'airdrop,' or a 'bootstrap.' Such changes may dilute the value of an existing cryptocurrency position and/ or distribute the value of an existing cryptocurrency position to another cryptocurrency." },
    { title: "Blockchain Risks", content: "Since blockchain is an independent public peer-to peer network and is not controlled in any way or manner by Gulfexchange, and we shall not be responsible for any failure and/or mistake and/or error and/or breach which shall occur in the blockchain ecosystem or in any other networks in which the Gulfcoin Coin may be used and/or traded. You will be bound and subject to any change and/or amendments in the blockchain system and subject to any applicable law which may apply to the blockchain. We make no representation or warranty of any kind, express or implied, statutory or otherwise, regarding the blockchain functionality nor for any breach of security in the blockchain." },
    { title: "Technology", content: "The relatively new and rapidly evolving technology underlying cryptocurrencies introduces unique risks. For example, a unique private key is required to access, use or transfer a cryptocurrency on a blockchain or distributed ledger. The loss, theft or destruction of a private key may result in an irreversible loss of cryptocurrency associated with this private key. The ability to participate in forks could also have implications for investors. For example, a market participant holding a cryptocurrency position through a cryptocurrency exchange may be adversely impacted if the exchange does not allow its customers to participate in a fork that creates a new product.The security of the Gulfexchange ecosystem, and associated core components, is a top priority for Gulfexchange. Our Proof of Stake network is secured by the already proven Gulfexchange ecosystem technology and provides valuable services for business or private use. Our mission is to become a layer of trust for digital financial systems at internet scale, and the highest level of security is a mandatory prerequisite.The security researcher community regularly makes valuable contributions to the security of organizations and the broader Internet, and Gulfexchange recognizes that fostering a close relationship with the community will help improve the security of the Gulfexchange ecosystem. So, if you have information about a vulnerability in the Gulfexchange ecosystem and associated components, we want to hear from you." },
    { title: "Cybersecurity", content: "The cybersecurity risks of cryptocurrencies and related “wallets” or spot exchanges include hacking vulnerabilities and a risk that publicly distributed ledgers may not be immutable. A cybersecurity event could result in a substantial, immediate and irreversible loss for market participants that trade cryptocurrencies. Even a minor cybersecurity event in a cryptocurrency is likely to result in downward price pressure on that product and potentially other cryptocurrencies." },
    { title: "Access risks", content: "There are a series of inherent risks with the use of the mobile and/or web-based trading technology such as latency in the prices provided, and other issues that are a result of connectivity (including, without limitation, the use of mobile networks). Prices displayed on the Trading Platform are solely an indication of the executable rates and may not reflect the actual executed or executable price of an order.The Platform may utilize public communication network circuits for the transmission of messages. Gulfexchange shall not be liable for any and all circumstances in which you experience a delay in price quotation or an inability to trade caused by network transmission problems or restrictions or any other problems outside our direct control, which include but are not limited to the strength of the mobile signal, network latency, or any other issues that may arise between you and any internet service provider, phone service provider or any other service provider. Please note further that some of the features available on the Trading Platform may not be available on any mobile application.Future Gulfexchange applications may require Users to download and install updates to the application or to their device’s operating system as such updates are made available. Failure to do so might lead to certain parts of the Services (including trading functions) becoming inaccessible to Members until such update has been successfully downloaded and installed. Performance issues and security risks may arise if Gulfexchange mobile applications are used on devices with customized or otherwise non-standard operating software or as a result of other software installed on such devices." },
